# Xmas Coding Handout


Starting off with the blank project, let's take a short look at the structure and what we're about to build.

## Semantic HTML 

### Explainer

- [Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/semantics)
- [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section)
- [order of headlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#accessibility_concerns)
- [paragraphs in general](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p)

we want to use [landmarks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main#landmark) like [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main#landmark) as descriptively as possible. since the card is going to be our core functionality, this will be part of our main tag.

- HTML is short for `HyperText Markup Language`.
- It is giving content on websites `meaning and structure`. You can imagine HTML as the skeleton
  or the most basic building block of the Web.

Let's analyze the word for more clarification:

- `Hypertext`: Refers to the ability of HTML to create links that link one webpage to another. (Either on a single website or in between different websites.) This is a fundamental aspect of the web and the idea behind the "world wide" interconnection.
- `Markup Language`: Refers to a syntax that uses specific element to structure or format a document. You have already learned about a markup language, which is called "Markdown". While Markdown has a very simple syntax and is primarily used for formatting, HTML is more complex and its primarily used to structure a document.

- `HTML element`: every piece of content in a HTML document is placed inside of an HTML element
- `HTML tags`: the elements are written in form of HTML tags, meaning surrounded by `<>` and
  `</>`
- `HTML attributes`: some HTML elements need additional information in order to work properly. This information is given by HTML attributes
- `local attributes`: There are attributes that are specific to some HTML elements, for example `src`, which only makes sense if a resource is supposed to be embedded into the webpage (e.g. images or videos)
- `global attributes`: There are also attributes that can be added to any kind of element. (e.g. `class`, `id`, `style`, `hidden`)

### The benefits of writing semantic HTMl are:

- `Accessibility`: Screenreaders can function much better with semantic HTML, which can help e.g. visually impaired users to navigate the webpage and have a better user experience
- `SEO`: It's relevant for search engines to evaluate the importance and the context of the different parts of a web page
- `Readability`: It's easier for other developers to understand your code. And also for yourself in the future!

### Coding

Write the base structure we'll need for the rest of the tasks:

```
<main>
  <section>
    <h1>Happy Holidays!</h1>
    <h2>Cheers to whoever</h2>
    <p>Lorem Impsum</p>
    <p>Cheers, XOXO</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

## style fonts with own classes

### Explainer

CSS means Cascading Stylesheets. While HTML defines the structure and semantics of your content, we use CSS for design and layout.

- Selector: A CSS selector is used to specify the elements to which CSS rules apply.
- Property: Name for a particular property to which a value is attributed.
- Value: The value we assign to a property.
- Declaration: Each pair of property and value is a declaration.

we only use `.class` selectors to keep specificity simple.

> ðŸ’¡ https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/ might be a good resource to find a color you like. feel free to copy and paste the names or values, as all of the colors are part of the HTML spec.

### Coding

Recommended stylings are:

- `<h1>` with
  ```
  .headline {
    font-family: "Mountains of Christmas";
    color: maroon;
  }
  ```
- either specific classes setting the `font-family` for text elements,
- OR let the styles cascade
  ```
  .card {
    font-family: "Caveat";
  }
  ```

## Split our card into two sections

We need the predefined classes `.card`, `.front` and `.back` to be added to their respective tags in order to apply the global styles:

- `.card` gives padding and is what will be flipped
- `.font` creates a default background color, stays in place absolutely positioned within `.card`
- `.back` gets rotated and flipped to the back

```
<main class="card">
  <section class="front">
    <h1>Happy Holidays!</h1>
  </section>
  <section class="back">
    <h2>Cheers to whoever</h2>
    <p>Lorem Impsum</p>
    <p>Cheers, XOXO</p>
  </section>
</main>
```

> ðŸ’¡ This _hides_ the back of the card. this might be surprising at first, after all the work we did, but is what we want.

## Import `createCardFlip` in `js/script.js`

### Explainer and Coding

When we click around we see that nothing happens, which is why we're going to add JavaScript to our page for interactivity.

To use the prepared functionality we brought with us, let's import a function in our `js/script.js`.
Let's edit the first line with import to look like the example below.

```
import { createCardFlip } from "/lib/sketch.js";

createCardFlip();
```

Note that the name we imported is being used in a line below the import. We also added `()`-brackets to the name, to tell our browser to _run_ that function we just imported.

Try clicking around again. We should now see that our card flips.

## Add static image from `/images`

Now we're going to add a background image to our card.

To do so, let's go to the the end of the `.front` section in our `index.html`. Add a new `<img />` tag and use one of the prepared images from the `/images` folder.

Your code should look something like this:
```
<img
  class="postcardimage"
  src="/images/christmas-lights.jpg"
  alt=""
/>
```

> ðŸ’¡ the `img` should be at the end of the `.front` section. The order of elements is important!

We add our `class` attribute to include the predefined styles prepared. `src` is the file path where we placed our image. `alt` is a description of the image.

You should now see an image on your postcard. Depending on the image you picked, the headline might be hard to read. To fix that, this is a good chance to update the color of the `.headline` and add another class `.contrasted` with:

```
.contrasted {
  text-shadow: 5px 4px black;
}
```

## Import `createSnowfall` in `js/script.js`

Add `<div class="snowfall"></div>` to the end of `.front`. this does not show anything until the `createSnowfall` function is called.

That function needs to be imported, like we did with `createCardFlip` before. Let's edit `js/script.js` another import and call the function.

Your finished code should look something like this:

```
import { createCardFlip, createSnowfall } from "/lib/sketch.js";

createCardFlip()
createSnowfall()
```

## We're done! ðŸ¥³
### But are we? Let's keep styling!

you can add or change any styles in your CSS you want. keep in mind, that the order of your _rules_ is important! the last one wins. 
that is why we want to use single `.class` selectors and only write them in order after our `@import` of the prepared global styles.

- change colors
- change images
  - upload own images to codesandbox
  - use random url `https://source.unsplash.com/random?christmas`, or whatever query term, tell them to keep in mind that this is an external resource.
- change text shadow
- update texts, add more paragraphs
- add small image to back?
- configure snowfall
- configure flip
